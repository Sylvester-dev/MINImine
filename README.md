# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
Plan-
when a player goes to play the game:
They'll connect their wallet.
Our game will detect they don't have a character NFT in their wallet.
We'll let them choose a character and mint their own character NFT to play the game. Each character NFT has its own power.

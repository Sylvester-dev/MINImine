Reunite with your friends and get your weapons ready to fight against an army of zombies and enderDragon to protect your place in this turn-based NFT browser game.

The game is based on a world famous game *Minecraft*. It's made with help of Ethereum smart contracts (a piece of code that lives on the Ethereum blockchain). As its deployed to the blockchain, anyone in the world with a computer or smart phone can access it, run the smart contract, and play the game. The client website allows players to connect their Ethereum wallets and play the game!

The goal of the game is to **Kill. The. Boss**. 🗡 ☠️ 🔪

* Players begin by minting a weapon NFT. Each minted weapon has a certain *HP* and *Attack Damage*.
* Players use their weapon to attack the Final Boss and inflict damage. Watch out: the Boss fights back!
* Each weapon NFT has its own attributes (like HP, damage, etc.) stored directly as part of the NFT.
* Only one weapon per person can be used at a time.
* Need more power, *Charge* your weapon
* Feeling lucky, you can get an enchanted power-up attack.

## How to Play
1. Go the the [game site](slugterranftgame.3lv.repl.co/)
2. Connect your metamask wallet with rinkeby network
3. Choose a weapon NFT to mint
4. Work together to fight The Final Boss, *The Ender Dragon*   


Each weapon NFT has the following attributes:
* Image
* Name
* HP value
* Attack Damage value

### How to Win
Players must work together to attack the boss and kill it by draining its HP to 0. Moral of the story: we can't do this alone.

## Rules
* Each player can only have 1 NFT character in their wallet
* If a character's weapon HP goes below zero, it dies >>> GAME OVER.

# Development
## Dev Tools
* Ethereum blockchain
* OpenSea or Rarible NFT marketplaces
* [HardHat](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/setting-up-the-environment.html)
* OpenZeppelin
* IPFS

To install HardHat (to compile and test smart contracts locally), you must have node/npm. After downloading & installing npm, create & move into the directory for your game, initialize npm, & install HardHat:
```
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

## Staging & Testing 
### Tools
* OpenSea TestNets
* MyCrypto ETH faucet
* Rinkeby TestNet & [TestNet Explorer](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)
* AlchemyAPI 
* MetaMask ETH wallet
* Replit/VScode

### Updating Smart Contracts
When making changes to immutable smart contracts, you must...
* re-deploy (which will reset all variables & lose all NFT data): `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby`
* update the contract address (from the console log) on the frontend: change `contractAddress` in `constants.js`
* then update the ABI file on the frontend (just copy from `artifacts/contracts/<game>.sol/<game>.json`)

### Working on features
* To display a leaderboard
* Give multiple attack option like power and booster attack
* Adding charge particle to enchant and powerup our weapon
* Making our weapon a real asset
